            Currently building frontend for a large-scale self-hosted product with React and
            TypeScript. Beyond writing code, I review MRs, mentor frontend developers, run technical
            interviews, and onboard new engineers.

            10+ years in the industry — from jQuery and Angular.js to modern component
            architectures. That journey shaped how I think about maintainable systems and team
            productivity.
