  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan Kalinichenko â€” a Senior Frontend Developer specializing in JavaScript,
    TypeScript, and React.
  </p>
  <p>
    With over a decade of experience building scalable, maintainable web applications, I focus on
    clean architecture, smooth UI/UX, and modern frontend practices. I enjoy working in distributed
    teams and turning complex ideas into elegant interfaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    While frontend is my core focus, Iâ€™m also passionate about backend development with Node.js and
    enjoy experimenting with AI using Python.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site is where I share thoughts on frontend development, architecture, productivity, and
    remote work. Feel free to get in touch if anything here resonates with you.
