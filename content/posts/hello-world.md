Hey, I'm Ivan — a frontend engineer who's been building for the web for over a decade.

I finally got around to setting up a proper blog. This is it. Nothing fancy, just a place to write about things I run into while working: patterns that click, tools that help, problems that don't Google well.

Lately I've been spending a lot of time experimenting with AI tools in my dev workflow — coding assistants, code generation, AI-powered reviews, that kind of thing. Some of it genuinely speeds things up, some of it is hype. I want to write about what actually works and where it falls apart, based on real usage, not marketing demos.

Beyond that, expect posts about developer tools, frontend architecture, and the kind of stuff you figure out after staring at a codebase long enough.

That's it for now. More soon.
